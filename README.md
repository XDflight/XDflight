- 👋 Hi, I’m @XDflight (Qirui Da), a high-school student from Beijing National Day School International Department. 
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff, especially something about underlying development - things that are really fundamental but extremely important.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OpenGL and theories about computer graphics. But I often learn multiple things in parallel, so what I mean is that for now, my focus is mainly on OpenGL & CG Theories, and I'm still learning other things meanwhile. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which involve both hardwares and softwares. 
- 📫 You can contact me by [My Bilibili Account](https://space.bilibili.com/353418335), or you can just post your ideas in the discussion section of any repository.
